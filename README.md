Metamath-lamp ("Lite Assistant for [Metamath](https://us.metamath.org)
is a proof assistant for creating formal
mathematical proofs in the [Metamath system](https://us.metamath.org/).
Unlike most other Metamath proof systems
(such as mmj2 or original metamath-exe),
users can use this proof assistant without installing anything;
you can simply run it directly using your web browser.

You can use the Metamath-lamp proof assistant *now* by going to the
**[Metamath-lamp application page](https://expln.github.io/lamp/latest/index.html)**.
If you want to view its source, file issues, or propose changes, see the
[Metamath-lamp source code repository](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp)

You can see the
[Metamath-lamp Guide markdown file](docs/index.md#metamath-lamp-guide)
