# Metamath-lamp Guide

This is the
[**Metamath-lamp Guide**](docs/guide.md) repository.

[Metamath-lamp](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp)
("Lite Assistant for [Metamath](https://us.metamath.org))
is a proof assistant for creating formal
mathematical proofs in the [Metamath system](https://us.metamath.org/).
Unlike most other Metamath proof systems
(such as mmj2 or original metamath-exe),
users can use this proof assistant without installing anything;
you can simply run it directly using your web browser.

Please go to the
[**Metamath-lamp Guide**](docs/guide.md) to learn more about Metamath-lamp.
This guide, primarily authored by [David A. Wheeler](https://dwheeler.com),
will help you learn how to use this tool.

You can use the Metamath-lamp proof assistant *now* by going to the
**[Metamath-lamp web site](https://expln.github.io/lamp/latest/index.html)**.

You can see and contribute to the Metamath-lamp code by going to the
[Metamath-lamp](https://github.com/expln/metamath-lamp) repository.
